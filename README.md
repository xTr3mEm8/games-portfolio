Game Portfolio
Welcome to my game portfolio! Below, you'll find a collection of games that I created during a Harvard course on game development, as well as other independent projects. Each project showcases different skills and techniques learned throughout the course and my personal endeavors. Some of these games were built upon starter code provided by the course, while others were created from scratch. I hope you enjoy exploring them!

Introduction
My name is Malus Cristian. I am from Bucharest, Romania, and since I was young, I have been captivated by games. As I grew older, I decided to dive into the world of making them. This portfolio is a reflection of my journey into game development.

Installation and Setup
Most of the games here work with the Love app, with the exception of Helicopter_Game, DreadHalls, Portal, and the Final Project. Please ensure you have the necessary software installed to run these games.

Gameplay Instructions
The controls for the games are similar to most standard games:

Technologies Used
Harvard Projects: Lua and C#
Unreal Projects: Blueprints and C++
Editor: Visual Studio
Features
Each project involved modifying and adding specific features to the games. For example:

Zelda: Implemented a way to pick up pots and coded health drops from enemies.
Pong: Created an AI to play against.
Challenges and Learning
Being new to the concept of game development, I had a rough start but slowly got the hang of it. Now, I know how to work in Unity and am gradually learning to work in Unreal. I have gained a lot of experience with C++ and now have proficiency in C and C# as well.

Future Plans
Right now, I am working on an open-world RPG game with a Zelda aesthetic and third-person view. I am excited about the possibilities and look forward to sharing more about this project soon.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or feedback on my projects. I look forward to connecting with fellow game developers and enthusiasts!
